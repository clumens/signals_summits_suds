swaite proposes we operate in NH as Limited Multioperator. This gives us 50/144/222/432. If we wanted more, we could go Unlimited Multiop.

Area 1 in the 2015 contest had a high score for LM as 13156 (261 totals Qs over 4 bands). Actually, in UM the top score was 13229 in area 1 (203 Qs over 7 bands), so if we feel that we can make a valid run at it, hey let’s go.

Focusing on LM at first would give us a more tight picture to look at so that we don’t get distracted.

We were discussing doing this on a summit - maybe double with SOTA activation?

Let’s look at equipment:

Power - We need a generator. Anyone have a small inverter? swaite’s generator is huge and weighs a ton.

Feel free to fill in below if you have equipment for these bands:

50MHz:
  -Radio: An 857 or similar would be great. swaite has an 817
  -Antenna: swaite has parts for 6m moxon. Any other options?
            clumens has a five element 6m beam that is way too large for portable operation, but would work fine from someone's house.  Rovers tend to use some sort of loop antenna for 6m.

144MHz:
  -Radio: Assorted HTs, swaite's 817, clumens has IC-7000
  -Antenna: clumens has plans to buy M2 2M7 yagi

222MHz:
  -Radio: clumens has 222 mobile. No SSB options, limited to 25W
  -Antenna: cheapham.com has a 9el HTEK (??) beam for $80.  Aside from that, some sort of vertical since it's going to be FM only.

432MHz:
  -Radio: Assorted HTs, swaite's 817, clumens has IC-7000
  -Antenna: clumens has Diamond A430S15, which is big but reasonable

swaite has HTs for the 3 higher bands here. Also has parts for antennas on those bands

  
Modes:
SSB is by far the contest favorite, but there's some limited FM action as well.  How I (clumens) have thought of organizing this is that we put one person on 6m, one on 2m, one on 70cm, and one on the rest/on a break.  Rotate every 30 minutes or so.  Because we can only have one signal on one band at a time, I propose that we give the 2m and 70cm stations an HT or mobile on FM.  They are in charge of responding to calls or calling CQ on FM.  That keeps us limited to one signal.

There's also CW on 6m and the microwave bands.  If whoever's operating 6m wants to run CW for their shift, that would be fine.  I don't know about digital modes during this contest.  I've not bothered looking.


Operating Location/Setup:

-Sounding like we'll be doing this at someone's house. Need to determine who is in, then we can pick a house


Logging:
clumens's logger isn't network aware and doesn't yet separate out operator vs. station callsign.  I'd propose paper logs and we format them later.  Each station has a clipboard that stays with the radio, not with the operator.  Don't worry about dupes.

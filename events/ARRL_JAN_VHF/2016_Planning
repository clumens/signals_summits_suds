swaite proposes we operate in NH as Limited Multioperator. This gives us 50/144/222/432. If we wanted more, we could go Unlimited Multiop.

Area 1 in the 2015 contest had a high score for LM as 13156 (261 totals Qs over 4 bands). Actually, in UM the top score was 13229 in area 1 (203 Qs over 7 bands), so if we feel that we can make a valid run at it, hey let’s go.

Focusing on LM at first would give us a more tight picture to look at so that we don’t get distracted.

We were discussing doing this on a summit - maybe double with SOTA activation?

Let’s look at equipment:

Power - We need a generator. Anyone have a small inverter? swaite’s generator is huge and weighs a ton.

Feel free to fill in below if you have equipment for these bands:

50MHz:
  -Radio: An 857 or similar would be great. swaite has an 817
  -Antenna: swaite has parts for 6m moxon. Any other options?

144MHz:
  -Radio: Assorted HTs, swaite's 817
  -Antenna: clumens has plans to buy nice 2m yagi?

222MHz:
  -Radio: clumens has 222 mobile. No SSB options, limited to 25W
  -Antenna: ??

432MHz:
  -Radio: Assorted HTs, swaite's 817
  -Antenna: ??


swaite has HTs for the 3 higher bands here. Also has parts for antennas on those bands
